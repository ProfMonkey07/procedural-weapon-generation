procedurally generating weapons in unity

this is just a prototype and is not complete. I am new to code so this was a small experiment. this works in unity.
 if you create a sword with two objects, a blade and a hilt. add the script to the hilt and then drag into the slots the blade and a particle emmiter.
 when it is running you can press spacebar to generate a sword.
 if anyone has reccomendations please tell me because I have no idea where to go with this next.
